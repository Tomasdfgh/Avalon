# Avalon Helper

A web app for managing the character reveal phase in The Resistance: Avalon board game. Players join a room, select characters, and privately view their role and any information their character should know (e.g., Merlin sees evil players, evil players see each other).

No more fumbling with cards or accidentally revealing information during setup.
